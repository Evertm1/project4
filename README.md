# Jam Factory

Jam Factory is a file sharing application for musicians. Users can start their own musical project by uploading a starter track (such as a guitar riff) and cover art image. Others can download tracks from existing projects and add their own tracks to build cohesive songs with one another.

# Next Steps
This project is considered a work in progess. I would like to redesign the user interface to include responsive buttons for showing/hiding forms. I'd also like to implement additional update and delete routes to give users more control. Finally I'd like to build a route to a user's profile page that can be accessed the project page.
