                    Jam Factory is a file sharing application that supports collaboration among all musicians.
                    Start your own project by uploading a singular track such as a bass-line or drum beat and wait for others to respond with their own musical contributions that compliment your work.
                    Check out existing projects below to immediately start jamming with others!
